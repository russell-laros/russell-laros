# About Me
Aloha! I’m Russell, a Data Scientist with a background in analytics, predictive modeling, and optimization. I currently work in industry building models that support real estate decision-making, and I use this GitHub space to explore ideas and sharpen skills outside of work.

Many of the projects here are side explorations: testing modeling approaches, working through data cleaning and feature engineering problems, and experimenting with different predictive techniques. I’m especially interested in machine learning and AI for automation and optimization.
