# üí´ About Me:
I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Business and am currently working towards completion of a Masters in Applied Business Analytics (expected January 2022).<br><br>Through my masters I have been exposed to many Analytics and ML concepts. I know how to perform exploratory analysis in R and Python using KNN, as well as more basic concepts. I've done Natural Language Processing using NLTK, used regression and classification models to make predictions. I've also done the entire TensorFlow Core through Google's tutorial program to get a better understanding of deep learning.<br><br>I don't have any professional experience in the Data Science/Analytics industry, but I'm extremely passionate about the field and want to start a career. My long term goals are to become an AI/ML engineer.<br><br>I'm especially interested in NLP and Image Classification, and projects that intersect the two fields.<br><br>Fun Fact: I have a 100 ton master captains license and work as a boat captain and scuba dive guide in Hawai'i. However, open to new opportunities and can relocate.
