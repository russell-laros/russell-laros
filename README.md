# üí´ About Me:
I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Business and recently completed a Masters in Applied Business Analytics.<br><br>Through my masters I have been exposed to many Analytics and ML concepts. I know how to perform AB testing, hypothesis testing, and clustering using K-means and heirarchical in Python and R. On the predictive side I've used regression, KNN, Random Forrest, and XGBoost. My true passion is for deep learning, I've completed the TensorFlow Core and advanced tutorials through Google, and am currently taking a course on PyTorch. <br><br>I don't have any professional experience in the Data Science/Analytics industry, but I'm extremely passionate about the field and want to start a career in it. My long term goals are to become an AI/ML engineer.<br><br>I'm especially interested in NLP and Image Classification, and projects that intersect the two fields.<br><br>Fun Fact: I have a 100 ton master captains license and work as a boat captain and scuba dive guide in Hawai'i. However, open to new opportunities and would like to relocate.
